INFO2950 Phase 1 for Luke Ellis 

Link to github: https://github.com/ellisluke/2950FinalProject

Ideas for datasets to use: 
- List of all Billboard Hot 100 songs for every week (or maybe some other Billboard chart)
    * There are already databases with this data available
    * This data could also be scraped from the billboard website
- Collections of song spectograms
    * I've found one database offering this for many billboard songs (though not all)
    * There might be a python library that can create such a spectograms, but I'm not
    sure that's computationally viable.
- Spotify's public dataset of song metadata
    * Spotify has a couple large databases available for free public use, just contains 
    metadata (album, artist, title, year, others)
- Database of song lyrics for popular songs
    * I've yet to find one, but I think it could be scraped from a website like azlyrics.com 
    * Since I would be pairing lyrics with a list of songs, it might be more efficient to 
    scrape the data than go hunting for the songs that weren't in the database after the 2950FinalProject

Questions for Reviewers:
- Are there any time expensive operations I should be aware of in the analysis of music?
- Are there any restrictions on python library usage for this project?
- Is it okay that my GitHub repository is currently public?
