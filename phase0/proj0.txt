For individuals:

Time management. Look at the schedule of project phase deadlines, as well as your current course schedule, exams, other projects, and commitments beyond coursework. Based on these time constraints, set a regular schedule for project work and outline it below.

I tend to work whenever I'm inspired, and I think I will have many moments of inspiration working on this project. So I will certainly work on it consistently as my mind has new ideas and as I have coding breakthroughs. That being said, my set times to work on this project will be Monday nights from about 10pm - midnight and  Sunday afternoons from about 2pm to whenever I feel like stopping. This will also ensure I hit the Tuesday deadlines too. I think I may also end up working on it some afternoons directly after the lectures on Tuesday and Thursday. Since I'm working alone, I'm confident that I will have a topic matter I'm interested and excited about.
